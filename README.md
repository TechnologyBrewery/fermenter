#Fermenter#
In brewing, a fermenter is a vessel in which unfinished ingredients become nearly finished beer. In Model Driven Architecture, Fermenter is a project that converts functional concepts into nearly finished applications. This approach allows for the quick definition and assembly of applications with the focus on functional concepts rather than technical underpinnings.
