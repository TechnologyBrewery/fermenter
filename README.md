#Fermenter#
In brewing, a fermenter is a vessel in which unfinished ingredients become nearly finished beer. In Model Driven Architecture, Fermenter is a project that converts functional concepts into nearly finished applications. This approach allows for the quick definition and assembly of applications with the focus on functional concepts rather than technical underpinnings.

## Approach ##
The Fermenter approach is simple - it is solely intended to generate source code based on simple, developer targeted model. This is the key difference between Fermenter and other MDA tools and approaches is that it puts a premium on developer productivity rather than architectural concepts or diagrams.
